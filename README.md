## Problem Domain

As a user, I want to quiz my knowledge on Netflix shows.

### MVP

The goal is to create a website that tests the user's knowledge of films and shows from being stuck at home binging on Netflix. We will create a game of ten questions matching an actor to the show or film that they were most recently in. Each question is worth two points and the score total will then be displayed to the user once all questions have been answered.

### Stretch

1. Add a hard mode of five additional questions as an option after the first round.
2. Blurred picture for hard mode.
3. A timer added to the test.
4. Try again button. DONE!
5. About us.
6. CSS styling with transforms and animations.

## User Stories

1. As an administrator, I want to have the ability to create new options so that I can test the user with current information.

2. As a user, I want to keep track of my score so I can compare to other users.

3. As a user, I want to find out how to play the game.

4. As a user, I want to be prompted how many answers were correct and incorrect at the end of the game.

5. As a user, I want to be able to complete the game in five minutes.

## Notes and reflections

- We had a lot of fun making this and we hope that you enjoy it!

The animation in particular took a while to get just right and making sure that the user is presented with randomized answer options without any duplicates to the right answer was also tricky.
