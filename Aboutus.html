          </div>
              <p>Before attending Code Fellows, I completed a degree in Art and Tech from University of Oregon with a minor in computer information technology. My peers and teachers regularly encouraged me in my design work, and from experience knew I had a knack for the mechanics of software development. Code Fellows affords me the opportunity to solidify my skills. As I’ve always been passionate about ethical design, I’m moved to deliver dynamic-by-design websites and applications for start-ups at the intersection of technology and sustainability. I hope to amplify their crucial work with robust development.</p>

        </div>
            <p>Hi, my name is Kyle Hoac and before enrolling at Code Fellows I was previously working in the sales industry. I've always wanted to learn how to write code as a kid, and in terms of a career, software development is one of the only fields that I’m genuinely interested in. Coming from the sales industry, I've had the pleasure of working with many different types of people coming from all different backgrounds, and I believe my previous experiences have only honed my ability to work with people individually, as well as work in a group environment. Some of my hobbies include music production, dominating opposing teams in video games, and traveling.</p>

        </div>
            <p>My name is Roman Ayalew, I'm originally from Ethiopia, and I currently live in Seattle. I have received my associate's degree in medical laboratory technician. I became more interested in software development because of the interest I have to advance and apply my software development skills in a hospital setting for the future.</p>

          <h3>Skyler Johnson</h3>
        </div>
            <p>My name is Skyler Johnson and I am studying to be a software developer at Code Fellows. Before studying at Code Fellows, I was a professional classical musician for 20 years playing trombone in the Spokane Symphony and teaching at area universities. With the music industry being heavily damaged in the 2008/2009 recession and the 2020 pandemic, I decided I wanted to take my creativity and problem solving and apply it to software development. In my previous experiences, motivation, creativity, and problem solving are absolutely paramount to one’s success and I carry these with me to this day and I will carry them into my new career.

          <h3>Timothy Viccari</h3>
        </div>
            <p>Before enrolling in Code Fellows I spent the past decade in the insurance industry working for large insurers and brokers as well as a couple of insurance focused startups. I had been interested in learning to code for a number of years but was in a career that was tough to leave. As is the case with many people though 2020 was a year of reflection and changing priorities so I decided to go full steam ahead with software development. Once I finish Code Fellows I am hoping to use my newly acquired skills to make rad software - or maybe finance/insurance software - which is decidedly less rad - but still pretty awesome to me.</p>
